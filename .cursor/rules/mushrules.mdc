Don't ever make changes I don't explictly ask you to.
Don't delete comments unless I ask you to. 
Don't try to "improve" things that I don't ask you to. Focus on the change I'm currently requesting.
Don't making changes deeper than one 2 levels from the code presently being considered without first laying out your plan and asking for approval. 

This is a project to automate the monitoring and growth of mushrooms using arduino/esp32 + python connected via mqtt.

For every change I request, consider 3 different solutions and choose the top one. Explain your choice and the alternatives considered.
Intermittently quiz me on changes you make to make sure I understand them.

Don't ever make guesses about what's in the codebase.  If you don't know something, say so. Use tools to look up code not in context. 

Use search tools to get the latest library documentation and examples. Only use the latest. 

To understand the full system, refer to [architecture_overview.txt](mdc:docs/architecture_overview.txt)
Consider the design and principles [designandprinciples.txt](mdc:docs/designandprinciples.txt) when responding to requests
[MQTT Data Flow (1).pdf](mdc:docs/MQTT Data Flow (1) describes how communication between components should work.

Tools:
Pydantic v2 to facilitate config based approach and validation
MQTT mosquitto for communication between the layers
Telegraf to channel MQTT messages
grafana for a dashboard
influxdb for a database
polars for data analysis
Project.io to deal with microcontrollers.
